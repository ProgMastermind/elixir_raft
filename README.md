# ElixirRaft

A learning implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Elixir, designed for understanding distributed consensus mechanisms.

## Overview

ElixirRaft is an educational implementation of the Raft consensus protocol, focusing on clarity and understanding rather than production use. It implements core Raft features including:

- Leader election
- Log replication
- Term management
- Cluster membership
- Persistent state management
- Network communication

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Server Roles
- **Leader**: Handles log replication and heartbeats
- **Follower**: Responds to leader requests and timeouts
- **Candidate**: Manages election process

#### Consensus
- Term-based leadership
- Log replication with consistency checks
- Commit index management
- State machine application

#### Network
- TCP-based peer communication
- Connection management
- Message serialization

#### Storage
- Persistent log storage
- Atomic state updates
- Crash recovery handling

## Testing
